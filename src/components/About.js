            Tyler T.’s music is energetic and unpredictable, intriguing and
            danceable, complex yet groovy. Innovative and eclectic, he creates a
            rich and textured sound by crossing and combining genres including
            acoustic rock, electric rock, folk, bluegrass, world, prog,
            psychedelic, and touches of jazz and electronica. Using a unique
            looping and phrase-sampling technique, he brings together a diverse
            roster of instruments such as guitar, keys, marimba, and didgeridoo,
            all of which he performs himself. He also often weaves in strings,
            mandolin, banjo, organ, saxophone, flute, and dobro to create a
            layered intricacy in his instrumental pieces, and a sense of texture
            that backs up his vocal performances.

            On acoustic guitar, he demonstrates a startling range of expression
            with harmonic and percussive techniques, while his voice whispers,
            rasps, grinds, and growls. According to Bandwagon Magazine, “He’s
            not only a world-class singer-songwriter in the folk/jam scene, but
            well versed in numerous instruments, making him a force to be
            reckoned with in progressive music as well.” Lyrically, he touches
            on eternal themes of love and loss, such as in the evocative “Stone
            Tree” and the wistful “Take Me With You.” What sets him apart is his
            ability to invoke folklore, such as in the tongue-and-cheek
            “Neanderthal Man.” He’s one of the rare songwriters who can convey
            the breadth of human experience with a sense of sincerity, as well
            as occasional irony and humor.
